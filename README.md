## Learn Kotlin With Examples: Project Challenge (Lab)

Project Challenge created to evaluate the technical content explored in the repository [aprenda-kotlin-com-exemplos](https://github.com/digitalinnovationone/aprenda-kotlin-com-exemplos). **In this context, we will abstract the following application domain:**

**[DIO](https://web.dio.me) has incredible `Training` that aim to offer a set of `Educational Content` focused on a specific technological stack, preparing IT professionals for the job market. `Training` have some important characteristics, such as `name`, `level` and their respective `Educational content`. Furthermore, such educational experiences have behavior relevant to our domain, defined by the ability to `enroll` one or more `Students`.**
